# Script Writers

Having the script writer rank means you’re part of the PowBot team and contribute to the community and library of scripts. There are a few different ranks with different perks and different requirements.

Any script put forward for an application must be able to show a good amount of understanding for not only the API but some good standard practices in your writing. For example having  good modularity and/or the use of some OOP practices.

There are 3 ranks available
###[Script Writer 1](/Script_Writer_Ranks/ScriptWriterRanks?id=script-writer-1) | [Script Writer 2](/Script_Writer_Ranks/ScriptWriterRanks?id=script-writer-2) | [Script Writer 3](/Script_Writer_Ranks/ScriptWriterRanks?id=script-writer-3)
## Script Writer 1

### Requirements
-    Script must not be a simple or easy script to make. Something like (but not limited to) a powerminer wouldn’t suffice.
-    You must keep and maintain at least 1 public free script to retain this rank.
-    Upload to a public GitHub repo and post the link in your application. This will be reviewed and any feedback will be provided.

-    You must keep and maintain at least 3+ scripts with one of these meeting the prior mentioned complexity requirement.
-    Unless a valid reason is present, upload to a public GitHub repo and post the link in your application. This will be reviewed, and any feedback provided by anyone with equal or greater rank.
