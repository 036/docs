# Proxy setup

## Step 0 - Pre-requisites

As with everything in the world, there are always requirements before you start working on something. The main ones for achieving proxy support on PowBot are as follows:

* A correctly setup bluestacks instance - [Click here](https://docs.powbot.org/#/The_Noob_Section/Installation)
* Working and stable **SOCKS5** proxies. 
** NOTE: We do not provide or recommend any specific proxy providers. Please make sure to do your research before buying. We do not recommend using any 'Free' proxies. You will face issues if your proxy is not stable.

## Step 1 - Download the files

* Proxifier APK - You can find this by googling `Proxifier APK`

## Step 2 - Install Proxifier

This step as is as simple as dragging and dropping the APK you have downloaded previously onto the instance you want to proxy.
Once installation is complete, you should see this icon:

## Step 3 - Adding a proxy

Open up Proxifier, and add a new proxy by tapping the `+` button:

Fill in the info as required and tap on save in the top right of the screen.

## Step 4 - Final configuration

On the main screen, swipe the `default` option under the `rules` tag  to get access to the edit button and click on it.

Underneath, choose the proxy you have created in the previous step and tap on the save button.

Now back on the main screen, you should be able to click the `connect` button. Accept any prompts that come up. After this, restart your instance and your proxy should now work when you connect!


NOTE: Remember that you will need to open Proxifier every time you restart your bluestacks instance. 



## Step HELP - I'm still having issues

There could be a couple of reasons why you may be having issues. These are listed below:
* Cannot connect to game - This is caused by your proxy not working correctly. Please confirm it is a working proxy and try again. Reconnecting sometimes does help. Replace your proxy if your provider allows you to.
* Powbot bar does not appear - This is caused because you logged into powbot before setting up the proxy. Simply remove the game from your instance, and re-install using the latest installer (this can be found on our discord under #downloads). Make sure your proxy is on before logging into powbot/the game.
* I am lost - Please join our discord and describe your issue in as much detail as you can. This will help us with helping you to troubleshoot your issue.
